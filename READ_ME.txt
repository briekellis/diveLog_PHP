Hello, 
The files in this folder are meant to be used for a PHP logging site using a SQL backend for data
persistance. 
There are several fields that need to be changed if different fields are desired. This is a fully
fleshed out site that is ready to be deployed and used as a live site. 
Because it is PHP, it needs to be run on a development server - https://www.easyphp.org/ is a good
free option (though it is a buggy program, it works well enough).

Best of luck and happy coding!
